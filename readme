Hello! 
Anyone looking for a great starter lab, I've got just what you need. Here I will outline the basics but for more specifc instructions you can watch this video: 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZeVbbZ0o0&t=2799s

Today we will be making a honey pot with a live attack world map in Microsoft Azure. 
  > make a subscription
  > make a resource group
  > create a vm 
  > create a log analytics workspace
  > connect vm to LAW
  > download map api: https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab/blob/main/Custom_Security_Log_Exporter.ps1
  > update api session key specifc to you
  > use log data to train LAW how to disern data
  > set up workbook in Sentinel
  > create Map widget and connect to log data
  > vioala!

I will be listing some code and other helpful instructions, but that's pretty much the gist of it. Have fun!

It's worth listing somethings have changed since this video was made:
1. Security has changed to Windows Defender for Cloud
2. A lot of the aspects in the LAW has been deprecated and grouped together. Look for those.
3. Data collection needs to be enabled for the VM and the resource group.
    see here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/monitoring-components#enable-auto-provisioning-of-the-log-analytics-agent-and-extensions-
4. use the code provided to skip the part of the video about discerning the data from the log.
